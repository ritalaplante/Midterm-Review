#Nested if else statements
#1. Write a funtion that takes in someone's age if their age is a multiple
#of 5 tell them they win a free vacation. If their age is also a multiple of 5
#tell them they win a car. If their age is also an even number tell them they win
#a house
#2. write in a function that takes in a number and tells the user if the number
#is a positive single-digit number. If it is a positive single digit number, tell
#the user that it is a positive single digit number. Otherwise, tell the user it
#not a positive single digit number. 

#And Or
#Write a function that does the same thing as the functions described above
#but uses and or statements instead of nested if else statements

#for loops
#1. Write a function called count down which takes in an integer and counts down by
#3s until you get to zero. Print the index for each iteration of countdown and
#let the user know if that index is even or odd.
#2. Write a function that takes in a string and uses a for loop to reverse that
#string.

#While loops
#1. Write the reverse string function using a while loop
#Write a function that takes in a secret number between 1 and 10. Ask the
#user to keep guessing the secret number until they guess correctly.
